    <!-- I decided to go with a sky themed time keeper. It's always interesting to see how the sky changes over the course of a day. It seems very natural and you can get a rough estimate on the time of day if you look up. I included notches on this side to track the time. every minute the sky will either get darker going down or lighter going up. I included symbols to keep track of the time and to add a little easy math behind it so it isn't just numbers. circle equals 1 and triangle equals 2. and 3 is both of them cause you add them. The pendulum waits a brief time to sync with the computer clock and then swings back and forth every second. -->
