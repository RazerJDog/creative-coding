    <!-- I went for a completed image swap puzzle kind of idea. the game where you slide a piece of the picture to the open space and try to rearrange the picture's pieces to see the true picture. The open slot is depicted by the black square and the picture has all been seperated into the segments it needs to be in order for the puzzle to work. I wanted to it completely random and take the chunks of the image and eandomly place them around the grid to simulate an incomplete puzzle to solve. but I don't know how to take the pixels and save them somewhere else and then redeploy them later in a different square. -->
