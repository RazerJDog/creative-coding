<!-- I Decided to go for more of an About Me kind of style. I talk about my interests in fairly clear detail and I decided to draw a pie chart showing the percentage spread I interact with those interests on an anual basis. -->

<p id="text">Hey there, I'm Justin Raze otherwise known on the internet as RazerJDog.<br>
  I've spent most of my life online. Getting to know people through video games.<br>
  Eventually I made my permament friend group online. I haven't met any of them in real life yet<br>
  but maybe that will change when we get older. As for interests, i'll list them out.
</p>
<ul style="background-color: dimgray; color: white; width: 630px">
    <li>Video Games (Shocker, I know)</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Soccer</li>
    <li>Astronomy</li>
    <li>Sci-fi stuff</li>
    <li>Super/Hyper Cars</li>
</ul>
<p id="text">I'll be going over all of my interests in further detail. starting from the top one.</p>
<p id="text">Yeah I know this one isn't a surprise. It's more of a surprise if this isn't one of the many interests a guy has.<br>
    I started playing them at a young age. I think Halo was my first ever game<br>
    that I played. And at the time I was like 5, but didn't have any knowledge of why it<br>
    was a mature game. Sure it had violence and cursing in it, but 5 year old me didn't know<br>
    what that meant at the time, and I enjoyed defeating Aliens. As for that I also<br>
    played a GTA game, I had no idea what to do in it, so I played it like a standard<br>
    sandbox game nowadays and did whatever I liked. Now, I can't stop. It's one of the main<br>
    forms of entertainment today.
</p>
<p id="text">Hiking, I used to like outdoors a lot as a kid. Had some neighborhood kids as friends<br>
    and I played soccer. But as time went on, I didn't get out much, too many fun games to play.<br>
    But then my parents took me and my sister on a different vacation. We went across the country<br>
    hiking atleast one hike/trail in some national and state parks. We did this 3 years straight<br>
    over summer. I collected keychains from the parks that had them available.<br>
    I want to do more hikning in the future.
</p>
<p id="text">Soccer, I've been playing it since I was like 3 or 4. I've recently stop, because of covid<br>
    and school. But I will say, I was pretty damn good at it. Made the Varsity team Junior year<br>
    of High school. And I was a starter in both Varsity and Travel. I played one of the hardest<br>
    positions, being Center Mid. I had to protect our defensive line, while also supporting our forwards.<br>
    If you can't tell, this involved a lot of running. I might get back into it someday when I have more free time.
</p>
<p id="text">I'm gonna merge Astronomy and Sci-fi together, because most Sci-fi things I like are space themed.<br>
    Take Star Trek for example. I like it cause they're in space. Same goes for Star Wars. I absolutely<br>
    love looking at the planets and at black holes. If I could choose how I die, I would want<br>
    it to be in a black hole. My favorite of the planets is definetely Pluto, and yes a dwarf planet<br>
    is still a planet in my books.
</p>
<p id="text">Alright let's come back down to Earth for a second. See what I did there with the space joke? no? ok.<br>
    This is an interest of mine that I've recently gotten into. Around 2015 or so. I wasn't that big<br>
    into cars until I played Forza motorsport 5. That game looked so beautiful. all the cars<br>
    were like they were real. And the cover car of that game looked super fine. I eventually got<br>
    that car in game and I loved how it felt to drive. The Mclaren p1 is now my dream car because of it.<br>
    And other super/hyper cars have come out that look so good. like the 2016 Ford GT.<br>
    and the Mclaren Senna. But none of them compete with the first time I got to handle the p1.
